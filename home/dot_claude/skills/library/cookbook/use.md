# Use a Skill from the Library

## Context

Pull a skill, agent, or prompt from the catalog into the local environment. If already installed locally, overwrite with the latest from the source (refresh).

## Input

The user provides a skill name or description.

## Steps

### 1. Sync the Public Catalog

Pull the latest dotfiles and apply:

```bash
cd <CHEZMOI_SOURCE_DIR>
git pull
chezmoi apply
```

### 2. Find the Entry

- Read both `<LIBRARY_YAML_PATH>` and `<LIBRARY_LOCAL_YAML_PATH>` (if it exists)
- Merge entries: append local entries to public ones; if a name appears in both, local wins
- Search across `library.skills`, `library.plugins`, `library.agents`, and `library.prompts`
- Match by name (exact) or description (fuzzy/keyword match)
- If multiple matches, show them and ask the user to pick one
- If no match, tell the user and suggest `/library search`

### 3. If Plugin, Install via CLI

If the matched entry is a plugin (from `library.plugins`):

- Run the `install` command from the entry via Bash (e.g., `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`)
- Verify by checking `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for the key `<name>@<marketplace>`
- Report success and skip remaining steps (plugins don't use target directories or file copies)

### 4. Resolve Dependencies (skills/agents/prompts only)

If the entry has a `requires` field:

- For each typed reference (`skill:name`, `agent:name`, `prompt:name`):
  - Look it up in the merged catalog
  - If found, recursively run the `use` workflow for that dependency first
  - If not found, warn the user: "Dependency <ref> not found in library catalog"
- Process all dependencies before the requested item

### 5. Determine Target Directory

- Read `default_dirs` from `<LIBRARY_YAML_PATH>`
- If user said "global" or "globally" -> use the `global` path
- If user specified a custom path -> use that path
- Otherwise -> use the `default` path
- Select the correct section based on type (skills/agents/prompts)

### 6. Fetch from Source

**If source is a local path** (starts with `/` or `~`):

- Resolve `~` to the home directory
- Get the parent directory of the referenced file
- For skills: copy the entire parent directory to the target:
  ```bash
  cp -R <parent_directory>/ <target_directory>/<name>/
  ```
- For agents: copy just the agent file to the target:
  ```bash
  cp <agent_file> <target_directory>/<agent_name>.md
  ```
- For prompts: copy just the prompt file to the target:
  ```bash
  cp <prompt_file> <target_directory>/<prompt_name>.md
  ```

**If source is a GitHub URL**:

- Parse the URL to extract: `org`, `repo`, `branch`, `file_path`
  - Browser URL pattern: `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<path>`
  - Raw URL pattern: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>`
- Determine the clone URL: `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`
- Determine the parent directory path within the repo (everything before the filename)
- Clone into a temporary directory:
  ```bash
  tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
  git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch> https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git "$tmp_dir"
  ```
- Copy the parent directory of the file to the target:
  ```bash
  cp -R "$tmp_dir/<parent_path>/" <target_directory>/<name>/
  ```
- Clean up:
  ```bash
  rm -rf "$tmp_dir"
  ```

**If clone fails (private repo)**, try SSH:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch> git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git "$tmp_dir"
```

### 7. Verify Installation

- Confirm the target directory exists
- Confirm the main file (SKILL.md, AGENT.md, or prompt file) exists in it
- Report success with the installed path

### 8. Confirm

Tell the user:

- What was installed and where
- Any dependencies that were also installed
- If this was a refresh (overwrite), mention that
